          From building full-stack applications using React.js and Node.js to developing secure and scalable backend systems, I enjoy turning ideas into real-world solutions. My projects — like TunePorter, a YouTube-to-Spotify playlist converter, and Shortify, a URL shortener — reflect my drive to solve problems creatively.

          I've also worked on research involving DDoS detection in SDN environments using machine learning, showcasing my interest in both development and network security. Whether it's through clean code or thoughtful design, I love creating things that are both functional and meaningful.

          In my spare time, I'm usually reading, listening to music, or exploring new technologies.
